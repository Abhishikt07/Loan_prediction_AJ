# Loan Classification Project: Data-Driven Insights for Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Overview üìä
Welcome to my **Loan Classification Project**! This repository contains the code, dataset, and visuals used in building a machine learning pipeline for predicting loan eligibility. In this project, I applied several classification algorithms to provide actionable insights for loan approval predictions. The project also tackles class imbalance using **SMOTE** and involves **hyperparameter tuning** for model optimization.

## Key Highlights ‚ú®
- **Data Preprocessing**: Performed extensive data cleaning and handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generated visual insights on features like job type, education, and marital status, as well as loan status distributions.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Leveraged **SMOTE** to balance the dataset, improving the accuracy of the models.
- **Classification Algorithms**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** for optimization
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics including confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores are provided to compare model performance before and after tuning.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Grouped Bar Chart for Job Distribution by Loan Status.
  - Histograms for Age, Campaign, Pdays, and Previous (After Cleaning).
- **Model Comparison**:
  - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
  - Confusion Matrix and Heatmap before and after hyperparameter tuning.
- **SMOTE**: Solved the class imbalance problem by oversampling the minority class, which greatly improved prediction accuracy.

## Repository Structure üìÇ
- **loan_detection.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **loan_classification_code.py**: The complete Python script for data preprocessing, EDA, model building, evaluation, and tuning.
- **Visuals**: Contains visuals generated from EDA and model evaluations.

## Getting Started üöÄ
To run this project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Loan_Classification_Project.git
   ```

## Results and Performance üîç
After applying SMOTE and tuning hyperparameters, the final **Random Forest Classifier** achieved an accuracy of **95%**, improving from an initial accuracy of **90%**. The model performed well across key metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, making it suitable for practical loan eligibility prediction.
